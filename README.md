Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) are permanent GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) tracking stations that continuously collect and record satellite signals to provide highly accurate real-time or near real-time positioning information.
Key Points about CORS Stations:
They are installed at stable, known locations and equipped with high-precision GNSS receivers and antennas.
CORS stations operate automatically around the clock to gather satellite data essential for precise positioning.
The data collected is transmitted to central processing centers where corrections are calculated and disseminated to users.
These corrections help improve the accuracy of GPS/GNSS positioning for applications such as surveying, mapping, construction, transportation, and agriculture.
CORS networks use techniques like differential positioning to correct positional errors caused by satellite signal delays or atmospheric effects.
The network infrastructure includes reference stations, control centers, and communication systems to manage data flow and processing.
CORS networks enable users to achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy over wide areas, enhancing the reliability and precision of spatial data collection and navigation systems.​
